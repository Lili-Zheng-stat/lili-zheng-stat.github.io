I am currently an Assistant Professor in the [https://stat.illinois.edu Department of Statistics] at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. \n
Before joining the University of Illinois, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Rice University, advised by Prof. [https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/genevera-allen Genevera Allen]. I completed my Ph.D. in the [https://stat.wisc.edu Department of Statistics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison], under the supervision of Prof. [http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~raskutti/ Garvesh Raskutti]. I received my bachelor's degree at the [https://en.ustc.edu.cn University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)] in 2016. \n
\n
*Research interest*: I am broadly interested in statistical machine learning, where I develop reliable methods and theory for large-scale and complex statistical problems. In particular, I have been working on the following topics: graphical models, interpretable machine learning, selective inference, missing data, time series.\n
